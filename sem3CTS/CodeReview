Code review

1.Code structure and naming conventions
-the package name is too generic. What is the module name?
-class name doesn't let us know any details
-the function name is too generic
- the function arguments names are not specific
-t and s must have meaningful names

2. Implementation
-too many magic numbers (hardcoded value)
-is t limited to {1,2,3,4} or can it be bigger?
-there are no validations for t,s, and perioada

3.single responsability & kiss
-outsource the intermediary operationsinto new simple functions
